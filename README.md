# ATM Design Implementation

Automated Teller Machine (ATM) designed using Verilog and implemented on the BASYS FPGA board. In this design, there is a login operation where the user first should insert their debit card and then enter his/her password. After having entered the password correctly, the user may do: 1) deposit/withdraw money to/from his/her account, 2) change the password of the account, or 3) log out from the ATM.

This project has been implemented for an undergraduate course CS303 - Logic & Digital System Design at Sabanci University
